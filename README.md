## Business Problem
Energy companies in deregulated electricity markets face critical challenges with price volatility and demand forecasting, where inaccurate predictions can result in $50-120/MWh losses during extreme events or missed arbitrage opportunities worth $2-5M annually. Manual processes are time-intensive (8-10 hours/week) and prone to errors, leaving trading teams reactive rather than proactive. This platform solves these issues by automating scenario-based forecasts (baseline, shock, delta) and delivering real-time executive dashboards for data-driven decision-making.

## Data Structure Overview
The dataset (`fact_energy_market.parquet`) is a time-series Parquet file structured for high-performance analytics, containing over 1M records of hourly electricity market data across multiple regions. It includes key tables for temporal, geographic, price, demand, and weather dimensions, enabling complex multi-dimensional analysis. Key columns feature temporal granularity (datetime), regional segmentation (e.g., zones), price forecasts ($/MWh), demand projections (MW), and simulated weather variables. The data supports scenario modeling with three output tables (baseline, shock, delta) for Power BI integration. An ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) can be visualized as follows: `datetime` → linked to `region` → forecasts for `price`, `demand`, and `weather` variables, with scenarios derived from historical and simulated data. This structure captures the domain's complexity, including volatility patterns and renewable energy impacts, allowing for accurate predictive modeling.

## Methodology and Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Automated pipeline pulls data from Parquet files and external APIs (e.g., weather data).
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats using Pandas and NumPy.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze correlations (e.g., temperature vs. price >0.6 during peaks) and volatility patterns.
4. **Forecasting Models**: Generate baseline (linear regression), shock (Monte Carlo simulations for extremes), and delta (comparative analysis) scenarios.
5. **Visualization & Reporting**: Create interactive dashboards with Plotly; automate weekly email reports via cron jobs.
6. **Evaluation**: Validate forecasts against actuals with metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and correlation coefficients.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Streamlit)
- **Data Processing**: Parquet files, CSV outputs, Power BI integration
- **Automation**: Cron scheduling, automated email scripts
- **Visualization**: Streamlit dashboards, Google OAuth2 authentication
- **Deployment**: Local/Cloud (Streamlit Cloud), Enterprise (Power BI)
- **Key Techniques**: Time-series forecasting, statistical modeling, scenario analysis, EDA

## Key Findings and Results
- **Price Volatility**: Shock scenarios show 2.5x higher volatility, with 300% spikes during weather events.
- **Regional Insights**: $8-15/MWh average price differences, peaking at $45/MWh during congestion.
- **Weather Impact**: Temperature correlates >0.6 with prices; solar/wind patterns enable intraday trading.
- **Automation Reliability**: 95%+ forecast accuracy, reducing manual work by 8-10 hours/week.
- **Business Impact**: Potential $500K-$5M annual gains in risk reduction and arbitrage for 500MW portfolios.

## Recommendations
- **Risk Management**: Implement dynamic hedging strategies based on platform-generated VaR metrics to reduce portfolio losses by 25-40% during high-volatility periods, directly addressing $50-120/MWh exposure risks.
- **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Deploy automated trading rules using the platform's regional heat maps to capture $2-5M annually in arbitrage profits for 500MW portfolios, capitalizing on $8-45/MWh price differentials.
- **Weather-Driven Optimization**: Integrate real-time weather APIs to enhance forecast accuracy by 15-20%, enabling strategic positioning around temperature-driven demand (correlation >0.6) and renewable output variations for better intraday trading.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Expand automation with real-time alerts for $100/MWh+ spikes, reducing manual work by an additional 5-8 hours/week and enabling proactive adjustments worth $500K-1.5M in avoided losses annually.

## Limitations and Next Steps
- **Limitations**: Relies on historical data; external factors (e.g., policy changes) may affect accuracy. No real-time market integration beyond weather APIs.
- **Next Steps**: Integrate live market feeds, expand to more regions, and add machine learning models for higher precision. Explore API endpoints for real-time access.

## Technical Implementation
